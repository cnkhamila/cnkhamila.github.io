				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>My name is Calyne Khamila and I am a Research Assistant at the department of Natural Sciences of <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/caragh-g-threlfall">Dr. Caragh Threlfall</a>. I recently completed a one year project co-advised by <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/michael-chang">Dr. Michael Chang </a> and <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/maina-mbui"> Dr. Joseph Mbui </a> from the same institution. I received my MSc from <a href="https://www.itc.nl/">ITC</a> of the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/"> University of Twente</a>, where I was studying in the <a href="https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/scientific-departments/natural-resources/"> Natural Resources department </a> that is part of the <a href="https://www.itc.nl/">Faculty of Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/persons/thomas-groen">Assoc. Prof. Thomas A. Groen </a> and <a href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/persons/bert-toxopeus">Assoc. Prof. Bert Toxopeus</a>.</p>
				<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>My research interests are in the area of remote sensing, statistical modelling and machine learning, and in developing methods using these techniques to support forest and biodiversity monitoring. My previous research focused on extracting vegetattion patterns remotely observed by airborne, synthetic aperture radar, unmanned aerial vehicle and multispectral remote sensing and species distribution models at regional and landscape scales. I have been particularly focused on estimating vegetation height, canopy cover and species distribution. I have also done research which involved analysing changes in forest structure over time and quantifying the relationship between forest metrics such as height, cover, biomass and net primary productivity. My experience also has been in uncertainty estimation in linear models and anomaly detection as these are some of the key challenges that arise when using remote sensing data to analyse environemntal problems. Overtime, I have become curious to understand how machine learning can improve our understanding of patterns in remote sensing of environmental data. It turns out machine learning models offer unprecedented possibilities to analyse remote sensing vegetation data at high accuracy while at the same time accounting for the sources of uncertainty in data and models.</p>
				<h3>Studies</h3>
				<p>During my Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science at <a href="https://www.ku.ac.ke/">Kenyatta University</a>, I discovered my interest in geospatial data science. This led me to further my studies with my Master in Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation with a specialistaion in Natural Resources Management at <a href="https://www.itc.nl/"> ITC</a> of the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/"> University of Twente</a>. The intensive practical oriented training approach at ITC led me develop a fascination of remote sensing and GIS data and a curiosity to understand the patterns and processes that can be derived from these data. It turns out remote sensing information can be used (in combination with in-situ measurements) in novel ways such as machine learning models to analyse the pressing spatial and temporal environmental challenges that the earth is facing today.</p>
				<h3>Work</h3>
				<p>I have worked in positions of remote sensing, GIS, forestry and environmental planning at <a href="https://regid-carbon.com/">Regid Carbon</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ffspak.org/">Farm Forestry Smallholder Producers Association of Kenya </a> and <a href=https://digireg.nl/>Digireg Netherlands BV</a>. Working on projects in these companies enriched my skills in data analysis, land cover mapping, spatial modelling of ecosystem services, biomass assessment and validation exercise, uncertainity estimation and anomaly detection</p>
